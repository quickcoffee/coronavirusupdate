# coronavirusupdate

When the [NDR Coronavirus-Update](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/podcast4684.html) announced that they would make transcripts of all episodes publicly available I firstly tried to scrape the PDF files, which [kind of worked](https://quickcoffee.netlify.app/post/topic-modelling-on-one-of-germany-s-most-popular-corona-podcast/) but was not very reliable. So I went back and now used the transcripts directly from the [podcast's homepage](https://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/info/Coronavirus-Update-Die-Podcast-Folgen-als-Skript,podcastcoronavirus102.html).  
Consequently I decided to create a R package to make it easy for anyone to scrape and access the data.

## Installation

You can install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("quickcoffee/coronavirusupdate")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(coronavirusupdate)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
